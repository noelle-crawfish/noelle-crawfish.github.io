#+title: Progress Narrative
#+subtitle: /"God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make your choice. Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness.”/ -- Aldus Huxley, Brave New World

I'm a huge fan of science fiction for many reasons:

To me, science fiction has always been a vessel through which to fuel my fascination with progress by giving me ideas to project onto the real world.
Yet in many novels, the progress of society is both a blessing and a curse, with authors warning of the challenges a technologically advanced future will bring.

In high school I read Aldus Huxley's /Brave New World/, the story of a futuristic world in which ... reduced to a hedonistic society optimized for pleasure.
- uses sex for shock value, but overexadgerates how much ppl like sex -> instead imagine a world in which you pursue your intersts all the time
- this is basically my life as a phd student (flexble schedule, work on whatever)
  I'm fortunate to be in a position where my life centers only around things I want to do. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois studying computer architecute...

People fear the unknown, and therefore society fears progress, even when science has unlimited potential to improve our quality of life.

- look at the blueprint guy
- what I'm going to do / how to follow along

  Despite not being an eccentric multi-millionaire, I'd like to .... using only technology available to the average person.
  This page describes the statistics I collect and some relevant goals I'm hoping this project can help me accomplish.

* Health
** Excercise
I am currently training in MMA, with they hope of making my amateur debut within the next few years. I've trained Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for a few years now, and I've recently added Muay-Thai, wrestling and MMA specific training to my schedule. I typically spend ~3 hours a day at the MMA gym (5:30PM-8:30PM).
Outside of MMA I try to run and lift regularly to supplement my training (though I am not as consistent with these as I'd like to be).
I record as many workouts as I can using my Garmin Instinct watch and HR strap, but I cannot wear these devices for grappeling workouts due to the safety hazard they pose for training partners. I also track mat-time using Toggl Track and journal my reflections after each practice.

*GOALS:* Improve as an MMA fighter, gain muscle
** Nutrition
- mention soylent green, kuru
My diet is already quite optimized, but the number of calories per day varies, so I track my eating with cronometer.
I get the first 1600-2000 calories of my daily nutrition from Huel, a meal replacement drink designed to provide users with all required nutrients and macros.
Since I need > 2000 calories daily, I use rice to cheaply increase my intake. I also drink gatorade after hard workouts.
For some fun and variety, I try to buy some fun snacks every week, with my favorites being vegan cheez-its, vegan jerky, and hummus.

*GOALS:* Reduce snacking, consume a clean high-protien diet
** Health Stats
From my Garmin, I can collect a large number of health and wellness related statistics including daily activity levels, resting heart rate, sleep data, etc. I also weigh myself daily and plan to get semi-regular blood tests done to ensure my nutrition plan is working.

* Time
** Research
As a PhD student, my main commitment is my research and productivity.
I spend ~12 hours per weekday in the office and work weekends as-needed based on deadlines and work left unfinished during the week. I track all hours worked using Toggl Track and split the tracking into blocks representing fine-grained tasks.
By the end of this year, I am hoping to submit my first first-author paper to a major conference. I'm also aiming for at least one more co-authored paper submission.
** Leisure
In my (somewhat limited) remaining time I enjoy rock climbing, practicing close-up magic, reading, and hanging out with friends.
- hours of scheduled vs unscheduled leisure time
-
** Social
For a long time, social interactions were something I struggled with a lot: talking to new people was hard, and determining who to consider a friend was even harder. Thankfully I was been able to improve my social skills dramatically over the course of my undergraduate career, but I still find there are certain things I struggle with. One major pain point recently has been that I will consistently put myself in social situations I know will make me /less/ happy due to a fear of "going-backwards" or upsetting my peers.
Therefore, I've started tracking who I interact with daily, and the type of interaction we have (e.g. casual hang-out, party, scheduled activity). I can examine this data alongside my happiness tracking to give myself an optimized strategy for deciding when I should engage in social activities.
* Money
I live in a low cost of living area making a salary of $2884/month ($34608/year) with very good job security. I track my spending meticulously using YNAB.
My current financial goals involve contributing to stock portfolio and savings account while putting aside some money for annual vacations.

* Happiness
Since my overall goal in life is simply to be happy, I use the Daylio app to track my mood and use the data to understand how my decisions are impactful to this end.
