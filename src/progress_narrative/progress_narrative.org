#+title: Progress Narrative
#+subtitle: /"God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make your choice. Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness.”/ -- Aldus Huxley, Brave New World

I'm a huge fan of science fiction for many reasons:

To me, science fiction has always been a vessel through which to fuel my fascination with progress by giving me ideas to project onto the real world.
Yet in many novels, the progress of society is both a blessing and a curse, with authors warning of the challenges a technologically advanced future will bring.

In high school I read Aldus Huxley's /Brave New World/, the story of a futuristic world reduced to a hedonistic society optimized for pleasure without meaning.
The story uses sex for shock value, warning of the perversions that might overtake our world if we are to allow unchecked "progress".
People fear the unknown, and therefore society fears progress, even when science has unlimited potential to improve our quality of life.
- overexadgerates ppls like of sex -> how would we ever get there, progress will always be in the direction fo the people

  While I'm not personally interested in avoiding death (better dead than bored), I'm fascinated by the idea of monitoring one's life using technology.
  Therefore, I'm setting out to do so using only commercially available tools easily obtainable by the average person.
  This page describes the statistics I collect and some relevant goals I'm hoping this project can help me accomplish.

  All data I collect can be found [[https://noelle-craw.fish/progress-narrative][here]], and will be updated at least weekly.

* Health
** Excercise
I am currently training in BJJ, Muay Thai, and MMA, with the goal of eventually competing in an MMA fight. I typically spend ~3 hours training on weekdays (5:30PM-8:30PM) and 1-2 on weekends.
Outside of this I try to run and lift regularly to supplement my training (though I am not as consistent with these as I'd like to be).
I record workouts when safe to do so using my Garmin Instinct watch and heart rate strap.
I also manually track mat-time using Toggl Track, which allows me to include training where it would be unsafe to wear any sort of hard plastic.
** Nutrition
- mention soylent green, kuru
My diet is already quite optimized, but the number of calories per day varies, so I track my eating with cronometer.
I get the first 1600-2000 calories of my daily nutrition from Huel, a meal replacement drink designed to provide users with all required nutrients and macros.
Since I need > 2000 calories daily, I use peanut butter to cheaply increase my intake. I also drink gatorade after hard workouts.
For some fun and variety, I try to buy some fun snacks every week, with my favorites being vegan cheez-its and hummus.
** Health Stats
From my Garmin, I can collect a large number of health and wellness related statistics including daily activity levels, resting heart rate, sleep data, etc. I also weigh myself daily and plan to get semi-regular blood tests done to ensure my nutrition plan is working.
* Time
** Research
As a PhD student, my main commitment is my research and productivity.
I spend ~11 hours per weekday in the office and work weekends as-needed based on deadlines and work left unfinished during the week. I track all hours worked using Toggl Track and split the tracking into blocks representing fine-grained tasks.
By the end of this year, I am hoping to submit my first first-author paper to a major conference. I'm also aiming for at least one more co-authored paper submission.
** Leisure
My (somewhat limited) remaining time is spent on hobbies and hanging out with friends. I'm looking to reduce the amount of leisure time I spend on social media or other 'mindless' things, and increase time spent learning/practicing interesting things. I track my leisure time using Toggl Track, and my screentime using StayFree (though this is subject to change if I can find a screentime monitor with a good API).
** Social
For a long time, social interactions were something I struggled with a lot: talking to new people was hard, and determining who to consider a friend was even harder. Thankfully I was been able to improve my social skills dramatically over the course of my undergraduate career, but I still find there are certain things I struggle with. One major pain point recently has been that I will consistently put myself in social situations I know will make me /less/ happy due to a fear of "going-backwards" or upsetting my peers.
Therefore, I've started tracking who I interact with daily, and the type of interaction we have (e.g. casual hang-out, party, scheduled activity). I can examine this data alongside my happiness tracking to give myself an optimized strategy for deciding when I should engage in social activities.
* Money
I live in a low cost of living area making a salary of $2884/month ($34608/year) with very good job security. I track my spending meticulously using YNAB.
My current financial goals involve contributing to stock portfolio and savings account while putting aside some money for annual vacations.
* Happiness
Since I believe my overall purpose in life is simply to be happy, I use the Daylio app to track my mood and use the data to understand how my decisions are impactful to this end.
