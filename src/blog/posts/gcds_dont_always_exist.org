#+title: GCDs Don't Always Exist
#+subtitle: lll

- premise -> When I was taking abstract algebra (MATH 417) as an undergraduate, my professor mentioned during class: "the GCD isn't guaranteed to exist"
- why is this interesting -> I'm mostly interested in discrete math, which even at the early college level matches well with our intuition of what numbers are
- a lot of the time when considering groups, rings, we talk about Zp, Zn -> hides the fact that we're doing something more than modular arithmatci
- lack of GCD existience is /intuitively/ very weird.
