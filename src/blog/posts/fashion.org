- Never been someone who dresses well
  - I think I have pretty severe sensory issues when it comes to clothing? 
    - basically only wear shorts / sweats + athletic wear
- Recently decided I want to dress better - but it's hard
  - after some searching, I found a pair of jeans I can wear all day (low waisted + baggy)
  - hard to get off t shirts
    - partially bc I've gained weight in college and feel self concious
    - partially bc t shirts are so comfy
    - also tshirts are free and nice clothes are not
      
- I cannot buy clothes on line -- end up hating 99%
- Dresses are great: you don't have to put together an outfit
  - started wearing sweaters over t shirts during winter and I thought I looked good, but often was told it did not match my jacket (overcoat) / pants (apparently sweater + leggings is bad?)
- matching is really hard
- no one likes my taste in shoes
  - I have a thing for obnoxious looking / weird looking shoes? really like the look of my vibrams
  - also thinking of getting moonboots for winter / when it rains

    
- makeup... this I've tried on occasion w/ awful reviews
  - one time I put on eyeshadow and had 3 seperate people
