#+title: Curiosity

I've always associated curiosity with intelligence -- obviously there are other components, but most /really/ smart people I know are also very curious. These people want to know how and why everything works, they ask questions about everything. 

I've also always considered myself a curious person. I spend a lot of time outside work/classes learning about things, and I enjoy thinking about interesting things. 
At the same time, I only find a small subset of things worth my time. Most things, in my opinion, are incredibly uninteresting, and I don't care to learn or think about them.

Does this mean I'm not curious?
