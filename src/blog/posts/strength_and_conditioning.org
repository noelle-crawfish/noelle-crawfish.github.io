#+title: Strength and Conditioning

- enjoy athletics, want to be stronger for bjj / muay thai / mma
- feel "out of shape" compared to men in the gym
- feel like by putting significantly more effort into the strength side I can match men in my weight class -> which do exist at gym. mostly v skinny, etc.
  - I'm lucky to be tall (5'7) so I have a shot
  - hard to benifit from training w ppl who can't even go close to full out
- also just like being strong / in shape
- excercise is fun
- want to be hot
