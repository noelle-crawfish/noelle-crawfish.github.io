#+title: Breathe: A Life in Flow
#+subtitle: "lkajdf" -- Rickson Gracie

- forward really hit me, not in the military, but good to hear that ppl there believe in bjj

- Read hoping for inspiration while at a low point in life: sick and unable to go to the gym, wanted inspiration to push through despite constantly passing out
- book is a bit heavy on the warrior spirit but that's what I needed
- interesting how he talks about family, some stuff is wild (so many children, fake pregnancies, no love for wives, etc.) but also some stuff is good (fond childhood memories associated w athletics that probably sucked at the time, reminds me of my own father)
- I really want to raise my own children as fighters (wrestling then mma probably), so it's nice to hear good anecdotes
