#+title: The Saint of Bright Doors
#+subtitle: "idk"

- worldbuilding, writing, storytelling, all amazing
- I like cults
- the study of the doors is so fun, bc it's so meaningless and yet they're so interested, beauty of academia
  
- feels like a work of art more than a book
- took a while to realize what it's really about, the first half felt like stage setting (but maybe I just missed some clues)
