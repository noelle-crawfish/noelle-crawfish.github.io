#+title: Some Desperate Glory
#+subtitle: "ldkajf" -- Emily Tesh

- won a Hugo, definitely deserved
- was unsure about reading bc of goodreads (queer space opera? what?) (also too rude to main character)
- really good execution of unreliable narrator, we are forced to trust what she knows for worldbuilding, and then are just as shocked as her when we realize we built the world wrong (loved)
- characters are fun, relatable (I see myself a lot in Val, also loved XXXX)
- not a huge fan of the ending, but whatever
- beginning was really uncomfotable to read, this gave me so much empathy for Val bc we share the same nightmare, almost put it down it was so horrible
- maybe not the best ever execution of multiple realities but pretty good
