#+title: Arcane

- LoL show
- watched with friends, probably would not have watched, and definitely would not have finished on my own
- S1 seemed kinda boring, no definitive plot (that I cared about at least)
- S2 was more interesting, I liked what they tried to do w the timelines, but things came together too late and too fast
