#+title: Severance

* S1 + S2
- Interesting bc the show definitely minimizes how bad the working conditions at Lumon, we see a pleasant day-to-day life
  - I think a lot of people, if offered the same job but without the severed part, would take it in a heartbeat? 
  - They make it really easy to forget about the "endless workday" think, wondering if that was a purposeful choice
- Dissapointed teh goats meant nothing lol
- also like, the numbers were kinda stupid I think, just doesn't make sense to have humans doing that kinda work or that it would translate or anything? Idk
  - Maybe more stuff will get answered in s3, but ...
